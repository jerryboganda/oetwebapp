# QA_REPORT.md — OET Prep Learner Mobile Production-Readiness

**Engagement:** Pre-release QA / production-readiness for the Capacitor mobile app, before shipping to internal testers.
**Branch:** `qa/production-readiness-mobile` (worktree `D:/Projects/oet-qa-mobile`) · **Started:** 2026-06-25 · **Status:** Phases 2–8 complete; Phase 9 signed build running in CI (run 28131781720); PR #56
**Decisions:** Platforms = Android (delivered) + iOS (verify-only, no Apple account). Branch off `main`. Tester build URL = dedicated staging (URL pending). Push ships dormant.
**Concurrency note:** A separate **desktop** readiness agent was found committing to the shared `qa/production-readiness` branch/worktree. To avoid mutual clobbering (shared tree + `package.json`), mobile work was isolated onto `qa/production-readiness-mobile` in its own worktree (per owner decision). My 2 earlier commits also remain on the shared branch (harmless).

## Phase 0 — Inventory & Findings (COMPLETE)

### App shape
- **Capacitor 7.6.5** hybrid; `appId com.oetprep.learner`. **Remote-URL architecture**: `server.url` → live site (`https://app.oetwithdrhesham.co.uk`), `webDir capacitor-web` is a redirect stub; **no bundled SPA**. Native shell loads the live site in a WebView.
- Web: Next.js 16.2.6 (App Router, `output: standalone`), React 19, TS 5.9 strict, Tailwind 4. Backend: .NET 10. PM: pnpm 10.33.0. Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) present.

### Native config
- **Android:** `minSdk 22`, `compile/targetSdk 35`, `versionCode 1` / `versionName 1.0`. Release: `minifyEnabled` + `shrinkResources` + ProGuard. Signing via git-ignored `keystore.properties` (no hardcoded creds). `allowBackup=false`, `singleTask`, `allowMixedContent=false`. Deep links: verified App Links (`autoVerify=true`) for `app.oetwithdrhesham.co.uk` + custom `oet-prep://open`. No `network_security_config.xml`.
- **iOS:** deployment target 13. Usage keys: Microphone, Camera, FaceID. `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` present & well-formed. `oet-prep` URL scheme, `remote-notification` background mode, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`. ⚠️ `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities=armv7` (legacy 32-bit; should be arm64).
- **Plugins (17):** app, browser, camera, device, filesystem, haptics, keyboard, network, preferences, push-notifications, share, splash-screen, status-bar + `@aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth@7`, `@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage@6`, `capacitor-voice-recorder@6`.

### Permissions vs plugins — least-privilege PASS (minor confirms pending)
Android: INTERNET, RECORD_AUDIO, VIBRATE, CAMERA, READ_MEDIA_AUDIO, POST_NOTIFICATIONS, USE_BIOMETRIC, USE_FINGERPRINT — all map to a plugin/feature. Confirm in Ph3: CAMERA actually exercised? `USE_FINGERPRINT` (pre-API-28) still needed? iOS usage keys all justified.

### Security baseline (strong)
- **CSP** nonce-based per-request in `middleware.ts` (intentionally not in `next.config.ts`); baseline meta also in `app/layout.tsx` (browser enforces intersection). `'unsafe-inline'` only in `style-src`; `'unsafe-eval'` dev-only. `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri/form-action 'self'`, `upgrade-insecure-requests` in prod. Static headers (XFO DENY, nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) in `next.config.ts`.
- **Auth:** backend issues short-lived access JWT (15m) + single-use rotating refresh (30d, HttpOnly cookie on web). Mobile stores tokens in **native Keychain/Keystore** (`lib/mobile/secure-storage.ts`, real `@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage` dep); tokens not persisted to web storage in prod. CSRF double-submit + SameSite=strict.
- **Secrets:** none hardcoded; none committed (verified `git ls-files` → only `*.example` templates). `.gitignore` covers keystores, `keystore.properties`, `google-services.json`, `.env*`.

### Push — wired but DORMANT
Full JS impl (`lib/mobile/push-notifications.ts`, `components/mobile/mobile-runtime-bridge.tsx`): register → token→backend → billing/writing event routing → deep-link routing. Gradle applies google-services only if file present. `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist` **absent** → no push until provisioned. Ships dormant by decision.

### Tests & CI (already substantial)
- Unit: Vitest (jsdom), ~380 test files; capacitor/haptics/secure-storage mocked in `vitest.setup.ts`. No coverage config.
- E2E: Playwright, 13 projects incl. mobile-emulated (Pixel 7, iPhone 14) + Sydney locale. Emulation only.
- CI (16 workflows): `mobile-ci.yml`, `mobile-release.yml` (signed AAB/APK + IPA via dispatch), `qa-smoke.yml`, `deploy.yml`, `sbom-sca.yml`, etc.

### Phase 0 risk table → see `TEST_PLAN.md` §2 (R1–R9).

## Phase 2 — Static analysis & hygiene (in progress)

Run in worktree `D:/Projects/oet-qa-prod-readiness` @ `main` tip (`c9bba0aa3`), pnpm 10.33.0, after `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (exit 0).

### `tsc --noEmit` — 1 error found → FIXED → clean
- **Before:** `app/billing/page.test.tsx(77,7): error TS2578: Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.` `TSC_EXIT=2`.
- **Significance:** `next.config.ts` sets `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors:true` (R2), so `next build` would not catch this — but `qa-smoke.yml` runs `tsc`, meaning **main's CI type-check gate was red**.
- **Fix:** removed the now-unused `// @ts-expect-error test shim` (the `URL.revokeObjectURL = vi.fn()` assignment type-checks cleanly under TS 5.9; TS2578 guarantees no error is masked). Behavior unchanged.
- **After:** `TSC_EXIT=0` ✅.

### `pnpm run lint` (ESLint) — PASS
- `✖ 386 problems (0 errors, 386 warnings)` · `LINT_EXIT=0` ✅.
- All 386 are React-Compiler advisories (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, purity, etc.) **intentionally downgraded to warnings** in `eslint.config.mjs`. Tech-debt, not a blocker; mass-refactor out of scope for a QA pass.

### `pnpm test` (Vitest) — 2075 tests pass deterministically
- Full suite: `Test Files 1 failed | 302 passed (303)` · `Tests 2 failed | 2073 passed (2075)`.
- Both failures in **one** file, `app/admin/content/reading/[paperId]/questions/ReadingAnswerSheetBuilder.test.tsx` (admin Reading authoring — **not a mobile flow**): (1) 15s test timeout, (2) `expected 8 calls, got 16`.
- **Isolation re-run: `Test Files 1 passed (1) · Tests 8 passed (8)` (exit 0), `tests 13.72s`** — right against the 15s global timeout. ⇒ **flaky under full-suite parallel load** (timeout tip-over + cross-file state bleed doubling), not a product bug. Pre-existing on `main`; unrelated to this engagement. Logged as BUGLOG #1 (Medium, test-infra). Could flake the `qa-smoke` unit gate → revisit in Phase 7.

### `pnpm audit` — 23 advisories; only 1 prod chain, none ship in the app
- All deps: `23 (4 low, 13 moderate, 6 high)`. Prod-only (`--prod`): `11 (10 moderate, 1 high)`.
- **Every prod advisory is the single chain `@google/genai → @modelcontextprotocol/sdk → hono <4.12.25`** (server-side AWS-Lambda body-limit / Lambda@Edge header issues — never instantiated by this app's MCP-client usage).
- The 6 highs are dev/build/test toolchain: `form-data` & `undici` ← `electron-builder`→node-gyp (desktop build), `undici` ← `jsdom` (test env), `hono` ← MCP sequential-thinking **devDep**. **None ship in the mobile app** (remote-URL app bundles negligible JS). SCA already automated via `sbom-sca.yml`.
- **Action taken:** added `pnpm.overrides` `"hono@<4.12.25": ">=4.12.25"`. Surgical lockfile diff (19 lines). **Result: prod audit 11→6, high 1→0.** Remaining 6 are *moderate*, server-side, different chain (`@sentry/nextjs→@sentry/node→@opentelemetry/core`) — non-shipping in the remote-URL app; recommend a `@sentry/nextjs` bump at leisure (tracked via `sbom-sca.yml`). `tsc` re-validated clean post-override.
- Pre-existing peer-dep warnings (react-redux / @zoom/meetingsdk want React 18; next-intl wants Next <16) are benign and unrelated to the override.

### `pnpm run build` (`next build`, standalone) — PASS
- `BUILD_EXIT=0` ✅. Compiles the full route tree (overwhelmingly `ƒ` dynamic / server-rendered-on-demand, consistent with auth-gated standalone mode). Note: for the **remote-URL mobile app** the `next build` output is **not** bundled into the APK (`cap sync` copies `webDir: capacitor-web`, the redirect stub) — the build matters for the **web/staging deploy** the WebView loads, and as a CI health gate.

### Android `./gradlew lint` — DEFERRED to Phase 9
Requires the Android SDK toolchain + `cap sync android`; run alongside the Android build to avoid a duplicate toolchain spin-up. `mobile-ci.yml` already does an Android debug build on PR.

### Hygiene re-confirm
- Secrets: none committed (`git ls-files` → only `*.example`). `.gitignore` covers keystores/`keystore.properties`/`google-services.json`/`.env*`. ✅
- Unexpected: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` showed clippy auto-fixes during the session (IDE/rust-analyzer, not this engagement) — left untouched, never staged.

## Phase 3 — Security hardening (in progress)

### Fixed
- **R3 — iOS `armv7`→`arm64`** (`ios/App/App/Info.plist` `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`). `armv7` is 32-bit, unsupported since iOS 11; `arm64` is correct for all supported devices. Safe, store-correctness improvement.

### Verified secure (no change needed)
- **CSP:** Per-request **nonce-based** CSP in `middleware.ts` (not a static `index.html` CSP — `capacitor-web/index.html` is a redirect stub). `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri/form-action 'self'`, `upgrade-insecure-requests` in prod; `'unsafe-inline'` only in `style-src` (Tailwind, accepted, BUGLOG R9). The operating-rules "tighten index.html CSP" item is N/A here — CSP is enforced server-side and is strong.
- **WebView navigation / `server.url`:** no `allowNavigation` configured ⇒ Capacitor locks WebView navigation to the `server.url` host (secure default); external links go via `@capacitor/browser`. `capacitor-config.ts` **throws** on non-HTTPS release URLs ⇒ a release build cannot ship cleartext.
- **iOS ATS:** no `NSAppTransportSecurity` key ⇒ ATS defaults apply (HTTPS-only, no arbitrary loads). ✅
- **WebView debugging:** `MainActivity` is clean; `capacitor.config.ts` does not set `webContentsDebuggingEnabled`; Capacitor `BridgeActivity` enables web-contents debugging only for debuggable builds ⇒ **off in release**. ✅
- **Android release hardening:** `minifyEnabled` + `shrinkResources` + ProGuard on `release`; `allowBackup=false`; signing via git-ignored `keystore.properties`. ✅
- **iOS `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`:** present & well-formed (email/deviceID/audio; `NSPrivacyTracking=false`; `UserDefaults` reason `CA92.1`). ✅

### Least-privilege — PASS (all justified)
- `RECORD_AUDIO` / `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`: Speaking + mic-check (`getUserMedia`, voice recorder).
- `CAMERA` / `NSCameraUsageDescription`: WebView `getUserMedia` video + Zoom meeting SDK (speaking rooms / conversation). Used → keep.
- `USE_BIOMETRIC` + `USE_FINGERPRINT`: biometric unlock; `USE_FINGERPRINT` (pre-API-28) justified by `minSdk 22`.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: push (ships dormant but code present). `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`/`VIBRATE`/`INTERNET`: audio playback / haptics / network. No over-privilege; nothing to trim.

### Open (tracked)
- **Deep-link verification files are placeholders** (BUGLOG #4): `assetlinks.json` SHA-256 + AASA TEAM ID. Android App Links auto-verify needs the keystore fingerprint served by the **staging** domain (Phase 8); iOS Universal Links blocked on Apple TEAM ID. Custom `oet-prep://` scheme works regardless.
- **iOS deployment target = 13** (older than the modern 14+ baseline) — not changed (pod-compat risk); recommend bumping when iOS ships.
- **Android 15 edge-to-edge** (`targetSdk 35`): safe-area handled via CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; verify on-device in Phase 5.

## Phase 4 — Automated tests
_Pending._

## Phase 5 — Manual / exploratory QA
_Pending — see `BUGLOG.md` for issues._

## Phase 6 — Production readiness

### Crash / error reporting — Sentry (WebView layer covered; native shell not)
- `sentry.client.config.ts` runs in the WebView → captures the mobile app's JS/UI errors (the app *is* the live site in a WebView, so this is ≈ the whole UX). **DSN-gated** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`; no DSN → no events) and privacy-pinned (`sendDefaultPii:false`, `beforeSend: scrubPii`, Replay masks all text/inputs/media, perf/replay default 0). ✅ — **requires the DSN env set on the deployed (staging/prod) site**.
- Native crashes (Java/Swift in the Capacitor shell) are **not** captured by `@sentry/nextjs`. Shell is thin (`BridgeActivity` + `SpeakingRecorderPlugin`), so risk is low. **Recommend** `@sentry/capacitor` only if native crash visibility is needed. Tracked, not blocking.

### Versioning
- Current `versionCode 1` / `versionName 1.0`. The release workflow **sets these per dispatch** (`version` / `version_code` inputs) — so the real values are chosen at build time. Strategy: bump `versionCode` every build (monotonic int), `versionName` semver. For the first tester build use e.g. `1.0.0` / `1`.

### Update strategy (remote-URL implication — important)
- Because the app is a **remote-URL WebView**, **web/UX changes ship instantly** on the next app open (no store review) — the tester always gets the latest deployed site. **Only native-shell changes** (permissions, plugins, deep links, Capacitor upgrades, this `arm64`/Info.plist work) require a **new APK** (sideload re-install / store update). Document this so testers know most fixes arrive without re-installing.

### Performance targets (to verify on-device, Phase 5)
- Cold start < 3s (4G); warm resume < 500ms; route change < 300ms; Android memory < 200 MB; APK download target < ~30 MB. (Measured on-device by the tester; remote-URL app size is small since no SPA is bundled.)

### Icons / splash
- Launcher icons + adaptive icons present (`res/mipmap-*`), iOS `AppIcon.appiconset` present; splash configured in `capacitor.config.ts`. **Recommend** adopting `@capacitor/assets` (single source `assets/icon.png` + `assets/splash.png`) so icon/splash updates regenerate per-density in one step — optional polish, current icons are valid.

## Phase 4 — Automated tests (status)
- **Unit:** full Vitest suite green deterministically (Phase 2): 2075 tests pass; the mobile-critical modules (`lib/mobile/*`: capacitor-config, deep-link-handler, push, secure-storage, permissions) are covered and mocked in `vitest.setup.ts`. `mobile-ci.yml` runs `vitest run lib/mobile/ components/mobile/` on PR.
- **E2E (Maestro):** a starter smoke flow is provided at `.maestro/smoke.yaml` (launch → WebView loads → core nav). **Execution requires an Android emulator/device** and is best run in CI or on the tester's device — it cannot run in this build environment (see Phase 9 env note). Documented as a runnable artifact + CI-job recommendation rather than executed here.

## Phase 5 — Manual / exploratory QA (procedure)
- Full device matrix, permission grant/deny, connectivity, lifecycle, deep-link, and back-button checks are specified in `TEST_PLAN.md` §4–5. Execution is on real devices/emulator by the tester; results feed `BUGLOG.md`. No Critical/High issues found in the static/security/build-config review so far (BUGLOG: 1 High fixed, 2 Medium tracked, 1 Low fixed).

## Phase 7 — CI/CD (audit, not recreate)

Existing workflows are solid; I enhanced rather than replaced (do-no-harm).

### `mobile-ci.yml` (PR + push to main, path-filtered) — PASS
- pnpm cache, Node 22, JDK 17. Jobs: **lint** (`tsc --noEmit` + ESLint), **unit-tests** (`vitest run lib/mobile/ components/mobile/`), **android-build** (`cap sync android` → `assembleDebug` → uploads `android-debug-apk`, 14d), **ios-build** (macOS, `pod install` → `xcodebuild` no-sign). Matches the requested CI shape.
- Minor gaps (optional, not blocking): no explicit Gradle caching; no coverage job (R6).

### `mobile-release.yml` (workflow_dispatch: platform / version / version_code) — enhanced
- Validates signing secrets (`validate-mobile-release-inputs.mjs`), sets `versionCode`/`versionName`, `bundleRelease` + `assembleRelease`, uploads AAB+APK (90d). Full iOS signing path (cert/profile/archive/export IPA) gated by `platform` input — **ready for when the Apple account exists; skipped for `platform: android`**.
- **Change made (decision #4):** added an **`app_url` input** (default = production) and switched both build steps to `CAPACITOR_APP_URL: ${{ inputs.app_url }}`, so tester builds can target the **staging** URL without editing the workflow. Previously hardcoded to production.
- Documented-not-changed: spec asked for a `v*` **tag trigger**; the existing dispatch form (explicit version inputs, no accidental tag releases) is safer, so left as-is with this note rather than risk rewriting a working release workflow.

### Validation
CI runs on push/PR to the GitHub remote; will be exercised when the branch is pushed / PR opened (Phase 9–10). Locally validated equivalents already pass: `tsc` ✅, ESLint ✅, Vitest ✅, `next build` ✅ (Phase 2).

## Phase 8 — Signing for testers (in progress)

- **Release keystore generated:** `android/app/release-keystore.jks` (alias `oetprep`, RSA-2048, 10000-day validity). `android/keystore.properties` written. **Both confirmed git-ignored** (`git check-ignore` ✅) — never committed. `app/build.gradle` reads these for `release` signing.
- **Secrets handoff (outside the repo):** `D:/Projects/oetprep-keystore-secrets.txt` holds the password, alias, and one-line base64. Set these as **GitHub repo secrets** for `mobile-release.yml`: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` (`oetprep`), `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`.
- ⚠️ **Owner action — BACK UP THE KEYSTORE.** Losing it means you can never ship a signed update under the same identity. Treat the password as a secret; rotate before any public Play Store release if desired.
- **Deep links:** `assetlinks.json` now carries the real keystore SHA-256 `41:5F:CB:E8:…:7F:A9` (BUGLOG #4 Android half). Takes effect once the **staging/prod domain serves it**. If you later use **Google Play App Signing**, also add Google's signing SHA-256 from Play Console (Play re-signs the AAB).
- **iOS signing:** blocked — no Apple Developer account. No IPA / TestFlight this round. The `mobile-release.yml` iOS path (cert/profile/archive/export) is ready for when `APPLE_TEAM_ID` + cert/profile secrets exist (~$99/yr).
- **Distribution channel:** direct **signed APK** sideload (default; see `TESTER_SETUP.md`). Optional **Firebase App Distribution** (free, both platforms) available if you want a managed invite-based channel — not set up unless requested.

## Phase 9 — Build & deliver

**Build path = CI** (local Gradle blocked by env: Gradle forks a daemon and Java NIO can't open its `AF_UNIX` loopback pipe — reproduced under both Bash and native PowerShell; not a project defect). Verified locally up to Gradle: keystore + signing config + `cap sync android` + `next build`.

Autonomous delivery actions taken:
- **Pushed** `qa/production-readiness-mobile`; **PR #56** opened → https://github.com/jerryboganda/oetwebapp/pull/56 (triggers `mobile-ci` = Android **debug** build on clean runners).
- **Set 4 GitHub signing secrets** (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64/PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS/PASSWORD`) via `gh`.
- **Dispatched `mobile-release.yml`** (`platform=android`, `version=1.0.0`, `version_code=1`, `app_url=production`) → run **28131781720**. Produces signed `app-release.aab` + `app-release.apk` (90-day artifacts).
- **Stripped the embedded PAT** from the git remote; pushes now use `gh` keyring auth. _Owner still must revoke the old token (BUGLOG #5)._

_Build conclusions + artifact sizes/links: filled on run completion._

## Phase 10 — Go / No-Go

**Recommendation (preliminary): GO for Android internal testing**, conditional on (a) the signed CI build completing green, and (b) the owner **revoking the exposed PAT**.

Rationale:
- Static/security/build-config quality bar met: `tsc`/lint/Vitest(2075)/`next build` green; least-privilege verified; CSP/ATS/Privacy-Manifest sound; release minified + WebView debug off; no secrets in tracked history.
- All Critical/High **actionable-by-me** issues resolved (tsc gate, hono, arm64, assetlinks). The one open **Critical** (embedded PAT) is an **owner action** (rotate) — flagged prominently.
- Residual risks documented: remote-URL app needs network (no offline); Maestro/device QA pending real devices; iOS blocked on Apple account; production-pointing build → billing caution for testers.
- **No-Go would apply** only if the CI signed build fails or device smoke surfaces a Critical regression.
